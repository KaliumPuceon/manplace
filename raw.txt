(See [[#Two decker|Two decker]]) The duplex house often looks like either two [[house]]s put together, or as a large single home, and both legally and structurally, literally shares a wall between halves. The duplex home can appear as a single townhouse section with two different entrances, though the occasional duplex with a shared common entrance and entry hall have been constructed.

{{main article|Multi-family residential}}

Specific terms under various American federal, state, or local laws dealing with fair housing, truth in advertising, and so forth, have been prescribed and engender specific legal meanings. For example, in American housing codes, all "apartments" must contain a kitchen, bathing facilities, and a sleeping area, or else that term may '''''not''''' be used. This generates various differences within the English-speaking world, and the terms such as "single-family", "two-family", or "three-family" building, residence, house, home, or property can be generic and thus convey little or no building plan (style of building) information. Such terminology is most common in advertising and real-estate markets that offer leasing of such units, or sales of such buildings.

* '''[[Apartment]]:''' a relatively self-contained housing unit in a building which is often rented out to one person or a family, or two or more people sharing a lease in a partnership, for their exclusive use. Sometimes called a ''flat'' or ''digs'' (slang). Some locales have legal definitions of what constitutes an apartment. In some locations, "apartment" denotes a building that was built specifically for such units, whereas "flat" denotes a unit in a building that had been originally built as a single-family house, but later on subdivided into some multi-unit house type.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apartmentchicagoweb.com |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 7, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012160800/http://apartmentchicagoweb.com/ |archivedate=October 12, 2007 }}</ref>

* '''[[Brownstone]]:''' a [[New York City]] term for a rowhouse: see [[rowhouse]].
